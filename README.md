Collect data about Rick and Morty characters from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters) and store them in a SQLite database.

Because we are on the intergallactic most wanted list, we wish to do so with haste by utilizing a multi-threaded architecture. Code must always be engaged in IO, we have no time to sit idly while pathetic network requests finish serially.

## DO IT MORTY
